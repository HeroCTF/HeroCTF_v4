### Write up

The stickers hint to the location being in England, by the seaside.
By scrolling through the long and strait parts of the English coastline in the 3D google maps view two buildings stick out in the town of Hastings : the Royal Victoria Hotel and the Marina Court building.
Finding the exact spot is now done by roughly triangulating the location of the stairs and by confirming the presence of the same stickers in the photos of Bansky's "Tesco Sandcastle".
