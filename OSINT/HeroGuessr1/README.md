### Description

Aaah, the South of France... the pétanque, the pastis, the marseillais qui savent pas conduire... 
I played a few games of pétanque in this parc, sadly I can't remember its name. Can you find it ?

### Write up

The name of the parc is partially hidden by the camping car.
By looking around Plage de Portisol on GMaps we find the parc: "Parc Victor Blanc"
