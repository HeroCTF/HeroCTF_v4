### Write up

In the photo we can see an ibis hotel logo, the old logo for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, the Eiffel Tower, and a building's roof with a distinct shape.
After looking through the ibis hotels not too far from the Eiffel Tower with google maps' arial view we find on with a very similar looking roof.
We can confirm it's the same one by dropping into street view (same pedestrian crossing, same building with the distinctive roof).
