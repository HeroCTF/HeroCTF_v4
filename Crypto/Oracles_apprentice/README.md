# The oracle's apprentice

### Description

Looks like the oracle took a nice long holiday and her apprentice had to cover for her.
She's new to the job so if she forgets anything... you'll just have to deal with it.
Good luck !

### Write up

TL;DR : 
send -1, as dec(-1) <=> n - 1
send enc(2) and recover e
send c * enc(2), as dec(c * enc(2)) <=> m * 2
