It is an easy challenge that does not require any knowledge. With the title, we can understand that we will have to look at colors. The flag is hidden in the image in diagonal with characters in the same color as the background. You will have to play with contrast and luminoity to find the flag.

If you want to play it simple, you can just send the image to Aperisolve and look at the results.

If you want to play it more finely, you can use GIMP or even Stegsolve https://www.wechall.net/de/forum/show/thread/527/Stegsolve_1.3/, which is very handy in this situation.
