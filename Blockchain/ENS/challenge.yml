This is a private 'ENS', which maps a name to an address.
If you manage to register the 3viL.com domain to be mapped
with the f address (0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff),
you'd burn all of their incoming funds !
(and you'd get the flag !)
Of course, this works only if the funds are registered to the f address.
